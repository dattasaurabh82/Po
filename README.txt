Project-Ostrich

===============



An art project reflecting on stoning behaviour of humans (tech includes, face detection, face tracking projection mapping etc etc ).


A live video from the back of a styrofoam face installation is projected on the face making the face psudo invisible. This is reflection on our own act where closing our eyes doesn't actually eradicates the problem; cutting yourself out from the situation doesn't make you protected. It may make you feel so but then that's your own feeling just like an ostrich when feels danger nearby stucks his head inside sand making "himself" believe tat there is no problem.  



We are going to use openCV in Processing for the facetracking of people infront of the installation and controlling of camera's angular point of view so that the projection of live video changes with the person's standing poition around the big styrofoam face. 



First install all the dependencies/libraries for Processing and mentioned in these two tutorials:
